    "* (Book) In general, the clustering coefficient of a node ranges from 0 (when none of the node’s friends are friends with each other) to 1 (when all of the node’s friends are friends with each other), and the more strongly triadic closure is operating in the neighborhood of the node, the higher the clustering coefficient will tend to be.\n",

    "* We say that the span of a local bridge is the distance its endpoints wouldbe from each other if the edge were deleted\n",
    "* Thus, in Figure 3.4, the A-B edge is a local bridge with span four; we can also check that no other edge in this graph is a local bridge, since for every other edge in the graph, the endpoints would still be at distance two if the edge were deleted.\n",
